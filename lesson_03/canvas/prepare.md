:key: = Vital concepts that we will continue to build on in coming lessons / key learning outcomes for this course.


## 3.1 Best Practices and Limitations
When to Use Threads (I/O-bound tasks)
The GIL's Impact on CPU-bound Tasks
Debugging Multithreaded Programs (Challenges and Techniques)
Thread Safety and Data Integrity

## Thread Safety:
Expand on the concept of critical sections by explicitly discussing thread safety.
Define what it means for code to be thread-safe and why it's essential for concurrent programs.
Discuss common sources of thread safety issues (e.g., shared mutable state).

## Deadlocks and Livelocks (Introduction):
While you mentioned deadlocks, consider providing a more detailed introduction to deadlocks and livelocks.
Explain the conditions that lead to deadlocks and livelocks.
Provide simple examples of how these problems can occur.
Even if you don't go into deep solutions, alerting students to these problems early is very helpful.

## Race Conditions (More Examples):
Expand on race conditions with more diverse and illustrative examples.
Consider examples that involve different data structures or operations.
Demonstrate how subtle race conditions can be difficult to detect.

## Context Switching:
Give a basic overview of context switching.
Explain how the operating system manages threads and switches between them.
This helps students understand the overhead associated with threads.

## Atomic Operations (Introduction):
If you have time, a brief introduction to atomic operations can be useful.
Explain that some operations can be performed indivisibly, even in concurrent environments.
This can provide a glimpse into more advanced synchronization techniques.

## 3.2 Thread Pools
Why Thread Pools? (Resource Management)
concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor (in Python)
Submitting Tasks to a Thread Pool
Managing Results (Futures)

## 3.3 Thread Communication
Shared Memory (and its challenges)
Race Conditions
Deadlocks, Livelocks, Starvation
queue Module (for inter-thread/process communication)
threading.Lock (Mutex)
threading.RLock (Reentrant Lock)
threading.Semaphore
threading.Condition (Wait/Notify Mechanisms)
threading.Event

## 3.4 Introduction to Inter-Process Communication
Why IPC? (Data Sharing, Coordination between Processes)
Challenges of IPC (Data Consistency, Synchronization)

## 3.5 IPC Mechanisms
Pipes (Unidirectional, Bidirectional)
Message Queues
Shared Memory (OS-level, not just within a single process)
System V Shared Memory
POSIX Shared Memory
Signals

## 3.6 Synchronization Primitives
Mutexes (Mutual Exclusion Locks)
Semaphores (Counting and Binary)
Condition Variables (Wait/Notify)
Barriers
Monitors (Higher-level Synchronization Construct)

Pipes:
Introduce pipes as a basic mechanism for inter-process communication (IPC).
Explain the concept of unidirectional data flow between related processes (parent-child).
Demonstrate how to create and use pipes in Python (using the multiprocessing.Pipe module).
Provide examples of simple data transfer between processes.

Queues:
Introduce queues as a more versatile IPC mechanism.
Explain the concept of a first-in, first-out (FIFO) data structure for communication between processes.
Demonstrate how to create and use queues in Python (using the multiprocessing.Queue module).
Highlight the advantages of queues over pipes (e.g., bidirectional communication, easier handling of multiple processes).
Provide examples of Producer/Consumer problems.

Semaphores:
Introduce semaphores as a fundamental synchronization primitive.
Explain the concept of a semaphore as a counter that controls access to shared resources.
Distinguish between binary semaphores (locks) and counting semaphores.
Demonstrate how to create and use semaphores in Python (using the multiprocessing.Semaphore module).
Show examples of how to use semaphores to control access to limited resources.

Barriers:
Introduce barriers as a synchronization mechanism for coordinating multiple processes.
Explain how barriers ensure that all processes reach a certain point before any can proceed.
Demonstrate how to create and use barriers in Python (using the multiprocessing.Barrier module).
Provide examples of scenarios where barriers are useful (e.g., parallel computations with dependencies).

Conditions:
Introduce multiprocessing.Condition for more complex synchronization scenarios.
Explain how conditions allow processes to wait for specific events or states.
Demonstrate how to use conditions to coordinate processes in producer-consumer or other complex scenarios.


## 3.7 Deadlock Prevention and Avoidance
Deadlock Conditions (Mutual Exclusion, Hold and Wait, No Preemption, Circular Wait)
Strategies for Deadlock Prevention (Resource Ordering, etc.)
Deadlock Avoidance (Banker's Algorithm - Conceptual)
Deadlock Detection and Recovery
